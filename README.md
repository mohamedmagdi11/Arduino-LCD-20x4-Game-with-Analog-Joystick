# Arduino LCD 20x4 Game with Analog Joystick

This repository contains the source code and documentation for a game implemented on an Arduino board with an LCD 20x4 display and an analog joystick using the Wokwi simulator.

## Game Description

The game is an interactive experience where the player controls a character on the LCD screen using an analog joystick. The objective is to navigate through a maze, collecting points and avoiding obstacles. The LCD 20x4 display provides real-time feedback and game information to the player.

## Requirements

To run this game in the Wokwi simulator, you will need the following:

- An Arduino board (compatible with Wokwi)
- An LCD 20x4 display
- An analog joystick
- Wokwi Arduino Simulator ([https://wokwi.com/arduino](https://wokwi.com/arduino))

## Setup

To set up the game on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine or download it as a ZIP file.
1. Open the Wokwi Arduino Simulator in your web browser ([https://wokwi.com/arduino](https://wokwi.com/arduino)).
1. Click on the "Open file" button in the simulator and select the `game.ino` file from the repository.
1. Connect your Arduino board with the LCD 20x4 display and the analog joystick to your computer.
1. Make sure the board and port settings in the simulator match your setup.
1. Click on the "Upload" button in the simulator to compile and upload the code to your Arduino board.
1. The game will start running on the LCD 20x4 display in the simulator.

## Usage

Once the game is running on the LCD 20x4 display, you can control the character using the analog joystick. Move the joystick to navigate the character through the maze, collecting points and avoiding obstacles. The LCD display will show the game status and score.
